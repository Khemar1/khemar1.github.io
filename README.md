### **Executive Summary**

As students in the Computer Engineering Technology program, we will be
integrating the knowledge and skills we have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include distance
sensors and actuators for controlling the movement of the vehicle. The database
will store the mapped area. The mobile device functionality will include remote
controlling the vehicle and displaying the mapped area and will be further
detailed in the mobile application proposal. We will continue to work together
this Winter semester as we all built similar hardware last term and worked on
the mobile application. The hardware was completed in CENG 317 Hardware
Production Techniques independently and the application was completed in CENG
319 Software Project. These will be integrated together this semester in CENG
355 Computer Systems Project as a member of this 3-student group.

### **Background**

The problem solved by this project is how to have a robotic vehicle that will be
controlled as an RC car with a mobile application, and which can work
independently as an autonomous car.

The Hardware which consists of the vehicle’s chassis where all the parts are
either connected or mounted on which includes the actuators, the H-bridge
driver, the ultrasonic sensors and the brain of it all the Raspberry Pi 3. The
vehicle’s sensors are used to avoid obstacles that are detected and at the same
time send data to be used to map an area that will be displayed in the mobile
application. Through Wi-Fi the ability to remote control the vehicle is possible
using the mobile application.

We have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content” [1] and have found and read the following three articles
which provides insight into similar efforts.

-   Algorithm Fusion for Feature Extraction and Map Construction from SONAR
    Data[@7158986]

-   SLAM for robot navigation[@4694832]

-   An Open-Source Scaled Automobile Platform for Fault-Tolerant Electronic
    Stability Control[@5398839]

In the Computer Engineering Technology program, we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,[@7158986]

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

### **Methodology**

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
Phase 1 Hardware build.  
Phase 2 System integration.  
Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

Abstract
========

So far human controlled robots have been great; they are able to complete many
tasks instructed by the user that's controlling them. As technology advances in
our world we have learned that a new form of robotic programming has been
developed to allow the robot to complete tasks on their own, independent of the
user. Artificial Intelligence(AI) has enabled developers to create robots that
are capable of operating on their own, making them even more useful and easier
to operate. To have a robot that is able to independently map an unknown area
would be great in many cases. One such case would be: if an area that a user
wants to map is small or has a small entrance where they may not be able to
physically enter, it is useful to have a small robot that can complete that task
on its own and return a visual map of that area to the user. The Auto Vehicle
has the ability to autonomously map an unknown area with the press of a button
on the mobile application. It independently avoids obstacles in its path while
always having the knowledge of its position in the unknown area. The vehicle
will record the data in the form of coordinates to be sent to a database which
can be retrieved by the mobile & web applications. The coordinates, when
retrieved by the mobile application, will then be displayed in the form of a 2D
map of the area.

**Introduction**
----------------

There are numerous areas such as: mines and sewer systems which are beyond the
reach of humans. These areas may either be too rigid or have entrances that may
be too small for an average sized person to reach. This report describes the
process followed for the design and utilization of an autonomous vehicle with
the ability to map areas that may represent an inconvenience for humans to
enter. The autonomous vehicle in question will be unmanned and will use
ultrasonic sensors to navigate and record coordinates in an area which will be
sent to a database. This database can then be retrieved by web and mobile
applications to display a map of the area. The information presented will be
centered on the design of the autonomous vehicle in addition to the mapping
algorithm which it will implement.

 

 

 

**System Requirements Document**
--------------------------------

 

### 2.1 Introduction

This section will give an overall description of the requirements document.

 

 

### 2.2 Overall Description

The following section will have an overview of the whole system. The basic
functionalities and how it interacts with the mobile application will be
explained. Lastly the constraints and assumptions of the system will be
discussed.

 

### **2​.2.1 Work Breakdown**

 

### **Hardware**

 

The Auto Vehicle’s chassis has all the hardware connected or mounted on it that
operates together to achieve the functionalities that are required from it. The
most important piece of hardware is the Raspberry PI 3, the microcomputer which
has all the other hardware connected to in where it receives data from and send
data to, it makes it possible to connect to the mobile application as well to
send and receive data. The hardware that sends the data to the microcomputer are
the Ultrasonic Sensors which are distance sensors, they are used to detect
objects that may appear in front of the vehicle then send a signal to the
microcomputer where it process it then manipulates the actuators according to
the data that it received, the actuators are DC Motors used to move the vehicle,
but before that the microcomputer actually sends data to the H-Bridge the driver
which based on the data controls the DC Motors direction.

### **Database**

 

The system requires two databases, one will be used to store the users that have
signed up to use the mobile application and another to store data of the mapped
area. The mobile application user’s database is a MySQL database on a free
hosting remote server, its main purpose is to store the information of users
that sign up for the application. This information consists a username and an
encrypted password which will allow the user enter the mobile application. The
second database, which is still in development, will be used to receive data
from the hardware while it is mapping an area. This data will be stored in the
database which can be retrieved by the mobile application to display the mapped
area to the user.

(Developed by Jan Yalda)

 

### **Web Interface**

 

A website will be developed to allow the user can login to his account. Each
specific user will be able to see their previous data been collected using the
AutoVehicle. One section of the web site will have a small bio for the
developers of the project and their contributions. Another page will contain a
step by step explanation for those who may wish to recreate the project on their
own. In addition to those, a section will be added to allow visitors give us
feedback and suggestions on how we may improve the project.

(Developed by Bilal Alfanous)

 

### **Mobile Application**

 

The AutoVehicle Application is used to communicate with the autonomous vehicle
remotely. It has in total 12 java classes which includes 6 activities. The
functions of the activities are as follows: Login Activity is the first page the
user will see when they open the application, it is where the user enters their
information to get their user specific information which is stored in the
database; MenuActivity is the page the user sees after they successfully login,
they can now choose whether they want to control the car or retrieve a map; The
register activity is where new users sign up with their information to be stored
in the database. After registering users will be taken back to the login page;
The remote control activity has a joystick which the user can use to control the
car; the settings activity is where the user can enter the ip address of their
car so that they can connect to it; the mapping activity is where the user can
see the map that their car has made, it will be blank for new user. The app will
work in unison with both the database and hardware to be fully functional. In
addition to these various features, the application also has support for both
English and French.

### **2.2.2 Product perspective**

 

The system mainly consists of a mobile application which will be used to control
the hardware as an RC car, the other use will be to start and stop the mapping
functionality of the hardware and to view the mapped area.

 

The mobile application has a login functionality which requires a user to be
existing in the users database. The mobile application sends a request to the
database to check if the user credentials provided matches one of the users that
exists in the database then sends a response back to the mobile application
which indicates if the user exists or not and therefore gives or denies access
to the main functionalities of the application.

 

After a successful login to the application has been made the two main
functionalities are presented. First the functionality to use the Auto Vehicle
as a remote controlled car, with this functionality the mobile application
communicates with the hardware using the internet and sends commands to be
received by the hardware and acted upon which are just basic remote control
functionalities. The second functionality the mapping of an area communicates
with the hardware the same way, it just orders the hardware to do the mapping
functionality instead.

 

### **2​.2.3 Product functions**

 

Using the mobile application, users logged in will have two main choices on a
menu first the remote control functionality and second the mapping
functionality. When the users choose one of them they will be taken to the
activity that is made for the functionality, where if its the users first time
logging in gets an alert saying that an IP address is required which is the IP
address of the Auto Vehicle, the user can just to add it right then or can
ignore the alert and provide it another time.

When an IP address is provided users going back to the two activities will have
the ability to actually connect to the Auto Vehicle and start any functionality
that they wish to perform.

The remote control activity provides the users with the option to connect to the
hardware using the connect button and start controlling it using the virtual joy
stick provided in the remote control activity and finally when they no longer
want to continue with this functionality they have the choice to disconnect from
the hardware using the button provided.

The mapping activity has the connect and disconnect buttons that have the same
functionality as in the remote control activity, but it also has two other
buttons one to start the mapping process and the other to stop it, when the stop
button is click the mapped will be send from the hardware to the mobile
application and displayed in this activity.

 

### **2.2.4 User characteristics**

 

The system is mainly meant for the users of the mobile application to interact
with. The only requirements are for the users that will use the application.

The users can sign up or login to use the remote control and mapping
functionalities. Where through the mobile application they can interact with the
hardware send and receive data from it.

 

### **2​.2.5 Constraints, assumptions and dependencies**

 

The main constraint on the system is that its dependent on the internet for
connection to be made to the database when the users want sign up or login,
connection to the hardware to be able to access the functionalities is also
dependent on the internet.

Another constraint is that the mobile application is only available in two
languages that are English and French, therefore users that don’t understand any
of those two languages will not be able to use the application.

An assumption about the system is that it will require the users to have a
certain android API (API level 19 and above) as a minimum requirement to be able
to get the mobile application on their smart phones, so users that have phones
that don’t meet that requirement wont be able to get and use the mobile
application.
