### **Executive Summary**

As students in the Computer Engineering Technology program, we will be
integrating the knowledge and skills we have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include distance
sensors and actuators for controlling the movement of the vehicle. The database
will store the mapped area. The mobile device functionality will include remote
controlling the vehicle and displaying the mapped area and will be further
detailed in the mobile application proposal. We will continue to work together
this Winter semester as we all built similar hardware last term and worked on
the mobile application. The hardware was completed in CENG 317 Hardware
Production Techniques independently and the application was completed in CENG
319 Software Project. These will be integrated together this semester in CENG
355 Computer Systems Project as a member of this 3-student group.

### **Background**

The problem solved by this project is how to have a robotic vehicle that will be
controlled as an RC car with a mobile application, and which can work
independently as an autonomous car.

The Hardware which consists of the vehicle’s chassis where all the parts are
either connected or mounted on which includes the actuators, the H-bridge
driver, the ultrasonic sensors and the brain of it all the Raspberry Pi 3. The
vehicle’s sensors are used to avoid obstacles that are detected and at the same
time send data to be used to map an area that will be displayed in the mobile
application. Through Wi-Fi the ability to remote control the vehicle is possible
using the mobile application.

We have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content” [1] and have found and read the following three articles
which provides insight into similar efforts.

-   Algorithm Fusion for Feature Extraction and Map Construction from SONAR
    Data[@7158986]

-   SLAM for robot navigation[@4694832]

-   An Open-Source Scaled Automobile Platform for Fault-Tolerant Electronic
    Stability Control[@5398839]

In the Computer Engineering Technology program, we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,[@7158986]

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

### **Methodology**

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
Phase 1 Hardware build.  
Phase 2 System integration.  
Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

### **Concluding remarks**

This proposal presents a plan for providing an IoT solution for AutoVehicle.
This is an opportunity to integrate the knowledge and skills developed in our
program to create a collaborative IoT capstone project.

Abstract
--------

So far human controlled robots have been great; they are able to complete many
tasks instructed by the user that's controlling them. As technology advances in
our world we have learned that a new form of robotic programming has been
developed to allow the robot to complete tasks on their own, independent of the
user. Artificial Intelligence(AI) has enabled developers to create robots that
are capable of operating on their own, making them even more useful and easier
to operate. To have a robot that is able to independently map an unknown area
would be great in many cases. One such case would be: if an area that a user
wants to map is small or has a small entrance where they may not be able to
physically enter, it is useful to have a small robot that can complete that task
on its own and return a visual map of that area to the user. The Auto Vehicle
has the ability to autonomously map an unknown area with the press of a button
on the mobile application. It independently avoids obstacles in its path while
always having the knowledge of its position in the unknown area. The vehicle
will record the data in the form of coordinates to be sent to a database which
can be retrieved by the mobile & web applications. The coordinates, when
retrieved by the mobile application, will then be displayed in the form of a 2D
map of the area.

**Introduction**
----------------

There are numerous areas such as: mines and sewer systems which are beyond the
reach of humans. These areas may either be too rigid or have entrances that may
be too small for an average sized person to reach. This report describes the
process followed for the design and utilization of an autonomous vehicle with
the ability to map areas that may represent an inconvenience for humans to
enter. The autonomous vehicle in question will be fully autonomous and will use
ultrasonic sensors to navigate and record coordinates in an area which will be
sent to a database. This database can then be retrieved by website to display
them to specific users when they log in. The mobile application will retrieve
the coordinates from the database in addition to a drawn map of the area which
it will be able to display to the user. The application will also be able to
remotely control the car through the usage of an onscreen joystick, through a
Bluetooth or WiFi connection. The information presented will be centered on the
design of the autonomous vehicle in addition to the mapping algorithm which it
will implement.

### 2.1 Introduction

 

#### **2.1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this small scale vehicle is to be able to autonomously navigate
and map an area. Autonomous vehicles are the current trend in technology and
this vehicle will be allow a user to make a map of an area without having to
physically carry out the task.

 

#### **2.1.2 Definitions**

An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment
and navigation without human input \*add citation

 

#### **2.1.3 Overview**

This vehicle is made using a combination of Raspberry Pi 3, Ultrasonic sensors,
and a motor driver. These components are built onto smart car chassis which will
be used to move. The ultrasonic sensors are used to detect obstacles and send
the information back to the raspberry pi.

 

2.1.4 Target Audience

The target audience of this project is students with a background in Computer
Engineering Technology who may have not taken part in a project of this type
before. These students students will typically be in their final year of study.

 

### 2.2 Overall Description

The following section will have an overview of the whole system. The basic
functionalities and how it interacts with the mobile application will be
explained. Lastly the constraints and assumptions of the system will be
discussed.

 

#### **2​.2.1 Work Breakdown**

 

##### **Hardware**

The Auto Vehicle’s chassis has all the hardware connected or mounted on it that
operates together to achieve the functionalities that are required from it. The
most important piece of hardware is the Raspberry PI 3, the microcomputer which
has all the other hardware connected to in where it receives data from and send
data to, it makes it possible to connect to the mobile application as well to
send and receive data. The hardware that sends the data to the microcomputer are
the Ultrasonic Sensors which are distance sensors, they are used to detect
objects that may appear in front of the vehicle then send a signal to the
microcomputer where it process it then manipulates the actuators according to
the data that it received, the actuators are DC Motors used to move the vehicle,
but before that the microcomputer actually sends data to the H-Bridge the driver
which based on the data controls the DC Motors direction.

##### **Database**

The system requires two databases, one will be used to store the users that have
signed up to use the mobile application and another to store data of the mapped
area. The mobile application user’s database is a MySQL database on a free
hosting remote server, its main purpose is to store the information of users
that sign up for the application. This information consists a username and an
encrypted password which will allow the user enter the mobile application. The
second database, which is still in development, will be used to receive data
from the hardware while it is mapping an area. This data will be stored in the
database which can be retrieved by the mobile application to display the mapped
area to the user.

##### **Web Interface**

A website will be developed to allow the user can login to his account. Each
specific user will be able to see their previous data been collected using the
AutoVehicle. One section of the web site will have a small bio for the
developers of the project and their contributions. Another page will contain a
step by step explanation for those who may wish to recreate the project on their
own. In addition to those, a section will be added to allow visitors give us
feedback and suggestions on how we may improve the project.

(Developed by Bilal Alfanous)

 

##### **Mobile Application**

The AutoVehicle Application is used to communicate with the autonomous vehicle
remotely. It has in total 12 java classes which includes 6 activities. The
functions of the activities are as follows: Login Activity is the first page the
user will see when they open the application, it is where the user enters their
information to get their user specific information which is stored in the
database; MenuActivity is the page the user sees after they successfully login,
they can now choose whether they want to control the car or retrieve a map; The
register activity is where new users sign up with their information to be stored
in the database. After registering users will be taken back to the login page;
The remote control activity has a joystick which the user can use to control the
car; the settings activity is where the user can enter the ip address of their
car so that they can connect to it; the mapping activity is where the user can
see the map that their car has made, it will be blank for new user. The app will
work in unison with both the database and hardware to be fully functional. In
addition to these various features, the application also has support for both
English and French.

#### **2.2.2 Product perspective**

 

The system mainly consists of a mobile application which will be used to control
the hardware as an RC car, the other use will be to start and stop the mapping
functionality of the hardware and to view the mapped area.

 

The mobile application has a login functionality which requires a user to be
existing in the users database. The mobile application sends a request to the
database to check if the user credentials provided matches one of the users that
exists in the database then sends a response back to the mobile application
which indicates if the user exists or not and therefore gives or denies access
to the main functionalities of the application.

 

After a successful login to the application has been made the two main
functionalities are presented. First the functionality to use the Auto Vehicle
as a remote controlled car, with this functionality the mobile application
communicates with the hardware using the internet and sends commands to be
received by the hardware and acted upon which are just basic remote control
functionalities. The second functionality the mapping of an area communicates
with the hardware the same way, it just orders the hardware to do the mapping
functionality instead.

 

#### **2​.2.3 Product functions**

 

Using the mobile application, users logged in will have two main choices on a
menu first the remote control functionality and second the mapping
functionality. When the users choose one of them they will be taken to the
activity that is made for the functionality, where if its the users first time
logging in gets an alert saying that an IP address is required which is the IP
address of the Auto Vehicle, the user can just to add it right then or can
ignore the alert and provide it another time.

When an IP address is provided users going back to the two activities will have
the ability to actually connect to the Auto Vehicle and start any functionality
that they wish to perform.

The remote control activity provides the users with the option to connect to the
hardware using the connect button and start controlling it using the virtual joy
stick provided in the remote control activity and finally when they no longer
want to continue with this functionality they have the choice to disconnect from
the hardware using the button provided.

The mapping activity has the connect and disconnect buttons that have the same
functionality as in the remote control activity, but it also has two other
buttons one to start the mapping process and the other to stop it, when the stop
button is click the mapped will be send from the hardware to the mobile
application and displayed in this activity.

 

#### **2.2.4 User characteristics**

 

The end user of this product will be a person with a desire to map an area
without having to carry out the task manually. They will also have access to a
smart phone with working Bluetooth.

 

#### **2​.2.5 Constraints, assumptions and dependencies**

 

The main constraint on the system is that its dependent on the internet for
connection to be made to the database when users want to sign up or login. A
connection to the hardware through internet or Bluetooth is also required to be
able to access the necessary functionalities from the mobile application. Using
Bluetooth to connect also provides a distance issue, in that it requires the
receiver to be within a certain range to be able to connect efficiently.

Another constraint is that the mobile application is only available in two
languages which are English and French, therefore users that may not understand
any of those two languages will not be able to use the application effectively.

An assumption of the system is that it the users to will have an android device
that runs on Android API level 19 and above as a minimum requirement to use the
mobile application on their smart phones. Users with devices that don’t meet the
requirements will not be able to download and use the mobile application.

#### **2.3.4 System Diagram**

![](system%20diagram.png)

 

#### **2.3.5 Mechanical Assembly**

To start unbox all the parts that come in the 4WD chassis kit then start by:

-   Putting the motor mounts on the chassis

-   Putting the actual motors on to the mounts

-   Putting the standoffs on the bottom chassis layer

-   Then screwing the top layer to the standoffs

-   Finally attach all the tires to the motors

-   Then find good spots on the chassis to mount the raspberry pi, sensor
    circuit which is on a bread board and the H-driver

-   Place the H-driver in a position close to the motors

-   To connect the H-Driver to the motors, follow these steps:

    -   Loosen the screws on the OUT ports (OUT1, OUT2, OUT3, OUT4)

    -   Put the red and black leads from the right motors of the car into OUT2
        and OUT1 respectively then tighten the screws.

    -   Place the red and black wires from the left side into OUT4 and OUT3
        respectively then tighten the screws.

-   After the H-driver is connected to the motors you must now connect the
    driver to the raspberry pi and the power supply

    -   Loosen the screws on the 5V, round and VCC ports

    -   Take the red lead from the power supply and place it into the VCC port
        then take the black lead and push it into the ground port. Tighten the
        screws on the VCC port but leave the ground port open for now

    -   a male to female wire and plug the header onto pin 2 on your raspberry
        pi (this is the 5V out pin) then push the male head into the 5V port on
        the motor driver.

    -   Using another male to female wire, plug the header onto pin 6 on the
        raspberry pi and push the male head into the ground port on the motor
        driver.

    -   You can now tighten the screws on the 5V and ground ports

-   And finally place the sensor circuit somewhere on the edge of the chassis so
    nothing will be interfering with the sensors like the wires.

#### **2.3.6 PCB/Soldering**

The files needed to recreate the PCB can be found at this link: [PCB
layout](https://github.com/Khemar1/khemar1.github.io/blob/master/PCB%20Eagle%20FIles/sensor%20board%20(2).zip)

Soldering onto the PCB is a simple task that even beginners can carry out but it
is recommended that you have at least basic knowledge of circuitry. Practice
before you solder onto your pcb to minimize mistakes

**Step 1**

Get a soldering iron, a PCB holder and some solder.

**Step 2**

Place the PCB into the PCB holder and plug the soldering iron in to heat it up

**Step 3**

When the LED on the soldering iron has turned green this means you can begin
soldering

Start by cleaning the putting some solder onto the iron and wipe it off on a
sponge (this is done to clean the iron)

**Step 4**

Look at your schematic then begin soldering on the necessary parts. (MAKE SURE
TO FOLLOW SCHEMATIC)

 

![](pcblayout.png)

 

#### **2.3.7 Power Up**

In this phase, you will be powering up your car and PCB(if you chose to use one)

 

##### Powering up the PCB

-   The raspberrypi by default comes loaded with an OS but it is recommended you
    reinstall it

-   Format the SD card then use http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/
    to write the image file
    https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2016-09-28/2016-09-23-raspbian-jessie.zip
    onto it.

-   Using the HDMI cable from the rapsberrypi kit connect the pi to a monitor

-   Using an Ethernet cable connect the pi to a source of internet.(or use wifi)

-   Put the sd card into your raspberrypi and power it on.

-   When the raspberry pi is powered on look for the ip address (hover cursor
    over internet icon or use ifconifg in the terminal)

-   Open remote pc, enter the ip address and connect to the pi.

-   Go to the six0four.github.io repository and look in the
    ModularSenseHatStripped folder for a file called traffic 2B.c. Download the
    file to your desktop.

-   Put the PCB header onto the raspberry pi’s pins

-   Go to the terminal and run the traffic 2B.c program, the LED’s on the PCB
    should now start changing colours.

 

##### Powering up the Car

-   Put the batteries into the battery holder

-   If the H Drive is receiving power from the batteries the LED should
    illuminate

-   Remove one of the batteries from the battery holder to turn of the motors as
    you will need to test if the raspberry pi is powering the motor driver

-   Plug in the raspberry pi and the LED on the motor driver should illuminate
    once again

-   Now put the batteries back into the battery holder and all components should
    be powered up

 

**Website Designing**

 

**Mobile Application**

The files needed to recreate the android application can be found at the
following link: <https://github.com/bilfnous/AutonomousVehicle>

You will need a physical device that runs on at least Android APK level 19(4.4 &
above) to run this application. A virtual android device is not recommended as
it does not have access to bluetooth.

-   Follow the link above to go to the repository where the android code is
    stored.

-   Download the repository or follow this direct link
    <https://github.com/bilfnous/AutonomousVehicle/archive/master.zip>

-   Unzip the folder

-   Open Android Studio

-   Go to file, new, import project, locate the project you just downloaded and
    click OK

-   After importing the project, wait for gradle to load then make sure that all
    the java classes from the repository can be found there.

-   Before continuing, enable developer options on your android device by going
    to settings, software info

-   Tap build number multiple times until a pop up appears saying you are now a
    developer

-   Go back to the settings menu and enter developer options, from there turn on
    developer options and enable USB debugging

-   Plug your device into your computer

-   Run the project in android studio by click the green triangular button or
    use the run menu.

-   After clicking the run button you will be met with a screen that asks you to
    choose which device you want to run the application on, choose your device

 

### 2.4 Specific Requirements

 

 

### 2.5 Progress Reports

 

#### *February 3, 2017*

**Status Summary**

With the remote-control part of the project completed we are now focused on the
mapping functionality and making adjustments to improve the hardware and the
software sides of the project. The android application is being modified to
prevent crashing when an incorrect IP address is entered and ways of
implementing the mapping functionality is being viewed to have a better
understanding of how it works.  

 

**Project Overview**  
The mapping functionality is still in the research phase.  
The android application is being modified to prevent crashing and incorporate
Bluetooth connectivity.

The web site is under development.

**Problems and Opportunities**

Mapping is a very hard concept to comprehend and implement. We’ve gathered
information from various sources which mainly include complex algorithms on how
to do it but we’re not quite sure how we can use it. This provides us with the
opportunity to collaborate with someone who has experience with robotic mapping.

 

During the last semester, we used a WiFi/Internet connection to communicate with
the car. This worked well from our homes but connecting to an enterprise
WiFi proved to be an issue. This has provided us the opportunity to learn about
Bluetooth connectivity and how we can incorporate that into our project.

**Budget Overview**

No changes to the budget thus far, we haven’t had to add anything to the
project.

 

**Conclusions **

Overall the project is still in development. Our goals for this month are to
prevent the application from crashing, understand and implement the mapping
functionality and have a skeleton for the website.

 

#### *February 17, 2017*

**Status Summary**

This week we met with our collaborator to discuss our options, as it relates to
mapping. After meeting with the collaborator new solutions were introduced, and
his ideas were taken into consideration. The rest of our time was focused on
enabling connectivity on our car. A solution has been found to connect the
vehicles to enterprise Wi-Fi. Project website started to take its overall design
and outlines.

 

**Project Overview**

The mapping functionality is still in the research phase but will now see some
progress after we take into consideration the options brought to us by our
collaborator. The Bluetooth feature for now will be on hold, as we’ve found a
solution for the Wi-Fi connectivity. The main page of the website is being coded
and the final outline of the website is taking shape.

 

**Problems and opportunities**

Jan: A meeting with a collaborator in the mapping field took place, and some
very interesting ideas were introduced. An electronic peripheral might be used,
such as IMU to enable us to sense angles. Another solution known as the flood
fill algorithm, is also being considered along with other ideas to do door
mapping.

Khemar & Jan: Bluetooth proved to be a strenuous task and it will be on hold for
the time being. While working on the Bluetooth functionality the Wi-Fi
connectivity aspect was fixed in the application. In addition to that, a
solution to our enterprise Wi-Fi issue was found by Jan. Moving forward, Wi-Fi
will be our main way of connectivity until we learn more about Bluetooth.

Bilal: Website development has been going smoothly up to now, and there is not
any major problem that worth mentioning, the major development was on the
skeleton and overall design of the website.

Link for AutoVehicle's website:

www.munro.humber.ca/\~n00994056/index.html

 

**Budget Overview                     **

After meeting with the mapping collaborator, we may have to adjust our budget.
Among other things, we have taken into consideration an IMU, which should cost
around 50\$.

 

**Conclusion**

Overall, there has been major progress in regards to the connectivity aspect of
the project, our goals have been met for this month with the app no longer
crashing when and invalid IP address is entered. We now have a clear idea of the
options we have to aid us in creating mapping functionality. The general outline
of the website has been shaped and for the next month the website will continue
to be in development, some initial mapping code and testing should take place.

-   Open your terminal and go into the directory where you downloaded the
    program

-   Run the program using the command: sudo python sensor2.py

-   Place an object in front of the sensor and it should return the distance of
    the object to the screen.

 

 

#### **Product Testing**

When unit testing has been complete and all problems resolved, you can now test
the car as a whole. Follow these steps to test that all components work
together:

-   Power up the raspberry pi

-   Put in the batteries

-   Connect the raspberry pi to a monitor or use remote pc to view the desktop

-   Login to the raspberry pi

-   Download [auto1.py](https://github.com/Khemar1/khemar1.github.io/blob/master/documentation/auto1.py)

-   Elevate the car so that it isn’t touching the ground (You can place it on
    top of something)

-   Go to your terminal and navigate to where you downloaded auto1.py

-   Run the program using sudo python auto1.py

-   The wheels should move forward continuously

-   Wave your hand in front of the sensors and the wheels should change
    direction

You can further test the car by placing it in an open area and watching it go

-   Follow the previous steps but use remote pc to connect instead of using a
    monitor. This is important because you want the car to move freely

-   Place the car in the open area

-   Run the program again

-   The car should move forward continuously

-   When the car senses an obstacle it should reverse and change
    direction(whether it be left or right. This is choses randomly by the
    program)

-   If it senses an obstacle in the direction it turned to then it will turn
    once again.

-   The car will continuously do this until it cannot find a path to continue

 

3. Conclusion
-------------

This autonomous vehicle is fully autonomous and uses ultrasonic sensors to
navigate and record coordinates in an area which can be sent to a database. This
database can then be retrieved by a website to display them to specific users
when they log in. The mobile application retrieves the coordinates from the
database in addition to a drawn map of the area which it will be able to display
to the user. The application can also remotely control the car through the usage
of an onscreen joystick, through a Bluetooth or WiFi connection. The information
presented is be centered on the design of the autonomous vehicle in addition to
the mapping algorithm which it implements.



4. Recommendation
-----------------

As the project is now, it can be further improved in many aspects. A power bank
can be used to power the motor instead of the AA batteries, this will allow the
motor to run for longer periods and it can also be recharged when not in use.
Currently the algorithm we use to do the mapping is very simple and specific to
our needs. There are other options that will allow the mapping to be done more
efficiently albeit with more complicated code.
